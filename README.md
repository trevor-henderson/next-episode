# next-episode

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to serve as an exercise in developing a React Web Application from scratch
and then subsequently migrating the application over to the NextJs framework. During the migration
process the intent is to document all findings and provide examples for issues that are encountered
as well as provide examples on how to navigate these issues.

## Documentation & Examples
Once the React Application becomes large enough for a non-trivial migration to the NextJs framework
documentation on findings, thoughts, examples, change logs, and links to other resources will
be provided to aid developers in understanding what goes into a migration to a framework such as NextJs,
as well as assist in potential migrations.

## Contributing
If you feel you can provide insight into this project or wish to engage in building an application
for the sake of exercise, please feel free to reach out and contribute. Whether you are an advanced 
developer that can provide insight into best practices or you simply wish to hone your skills while
providing to the community, all are welcome.
